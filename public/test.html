        Just an ordinary student who was born in 2001. I'm from Turkey and graduated from high school at 2019. My
        university education is still continuing at Istanbul Technical University, Department of Electrics-Electronics.
        I study Electronics & Communication Engineering, however my main interests are mathematics, theoretical physics
        and computer science-especially software part of it. Furthermore I really really like researching stuffs about
        Deep Learning/Machine Learning and cyber security. I use python unless no another language specified.Here is a
        list of languages I can use and my github adresses:
